Computer Setup Notes
====================
.. admonition:: Repository Overview
   
    - Personal note for keeping track of my computer **configs**, which I sync using symlinks.
    - Also enjoy being able to version control all of my ``rc`` files.
    - For source files, go to https://github.com/wtak23/configs/tree/master/source
    - `pdf version <./_static/configs.pdf>`__

.. note:: 

    - github has an excellent *file finder* system. Just type ``t`` at a repository to activate it (basically filters by filename you type in)
    - type ``?`` at a github repos page to see all the cool keyboard shortcut it has
