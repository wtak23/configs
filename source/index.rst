Computer Setup Notes
====================
Personal note for keeping track of my computer **configs**, which I sync using symlinks.

Also enjoy being able to version control all of my ``rc`` files.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :numbered:

    python.rst
    gitconfig.rst
    bash_config.rst
    sublime.rst

These substitutions are predefined in Sphinx

- ``|version|`` = |version|
- ``|release|`` = |release|
- ``|today|`` = |today|
