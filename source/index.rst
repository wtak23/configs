Computer Setup Notes
====================
Personal note for keeping track of my computer **configs**, which I sync using symlinks.

Also enjoy being able to version control all of my ``rc`` files.

    - https://github.com/wtak23/configs_master/tree/master/sbia-pc125-cinn/python
    - https://github.com/wtak23/configs_master/tree/master/cygwin

      - include the ``mklink`` instruction both under **bash_confg** and **windows**
    - https://github.com/wtak23/configs_master/tree/master/cygwin/office-setup 

      - move this under ``windows`` folder
